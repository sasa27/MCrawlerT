Choose & remove any splitter (S) in W
Case S is a simple splitter composed only of B
For each α∈A
Construct I={X |∃X∈P∧X =X∩T−1[B]≠φ}
11α
//i.e., I is a set of those blocks in P that are going to
be splitted by B
For each block X in I:
Compute X = X ∩ T −1[B] 1α
Compute X =X−T−1[B] 2α
Compute map infoB
Check (X,X1,X2) & Update P and W (if required):
If ((X1==0) || (X2==0))
Do nothing! //No split
If ((X1>0) && (X2>0)) Remove X from P.
Add X1 to P.
Add X2 to P.
Add (X,X1,X2) to W.



Case S is a compound splitter composed of (B,Bi,Bii) // B = Bi ∪ Bii ,
assume |Bi|<|Bii| For each α∈A
Construct I={X|X∈P∧X⊆T−1[B]} α
//i.e., I is a set of those blocks in P that are going to be splitted by S
// NB: P is already refined w.r.t. B.
Calculate map infoBi
For each block X in I:
Compute (X1,X2,X3) as follows:
X1: Set of states in X that goes to Bi but not to Bii with action α.
X2: Set of states in X that goes to Bii but not to Bi with action α.
X3: Set of states in X that goes to both Bi and Bii.
// This 3 subblocks are calculated directly from infoB and infoB1 as follows:
For each state s in block X:
If (infoBi[s][α]== infoB[s][α])
Add s to X1
infoBii[s][α]=0 If (infoBi[s][α]== 0)
Add s to X2
infoBii[s][α]=infoB[s][α]
If ((infoBi[s][α]> 0) &&( infoBi[s][α]<
infoB[s][α] ))
Add s to X3
infoBii[s][α]=infoB[s][α]- infoBi[s][α]
Check (X1,X2,X3) & Update P and W (if required): If ((X==X1) || (X==X2)|| (X==X3))
                           Do nothing! //No split
                      Else
Replace X in P by non-null X1,X2,X3
Add nun-null X1,X2,X3 to W in the same way as in the simple splitter case, except that if all X1,X2,X3 are non-null add the following to W: (X,X1,X23),(X23,X2,X3)
